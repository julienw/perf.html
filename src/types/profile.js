/**
 * The stack table stores the tree of stack nodes of a thread.
 * The shape of the tree is encoded in the prefix column: Root stack nodes have
 * null as their prefix, and every non-root stack has the stack index of its
 * "caller" / "parent" as its prefix.
 * Every stack node also has a frame and a category.
 * A "call stack" is a list of frames. Every stack index in the stack table
 * represents such a call stack; the "list of frames" is obtained by walking
 * the path in the tree from the root to the given stack node.
 *
 * Stacks are used in the thread's samples; each sample refers to a stack index.
 * Stacks can be shared between samples.
 *
 * With this representation, every sample only needs to store a single integer
 * to identify the sample's stack.
 * We take advantage of the fact that many call stacks in the profile have a
 * shared prefix; storing these stacks as a tree saves a lot of space compared
 * to storing them as actual lists of frames.
 *
 * The category of a stack node is always non-null and is derived from a stack's
 * frame and its prefix. Frames can have null categories, stacks cannot. If a
 * stack's frame has a null category, the stack inherits the category of its
 * prefix stack. Root stacks whose frame has a null stack have their category
 * set to the "default category". (The default category is currently defined as
 * the category in the profile's category list whose color is "grey", and such
 * a category is required to be present.)
 *
 * You could argue that the stack table's category column is derived data and as
 * such doesn't need to be stored in the profile itself. This is true, but
 * storing this information in the stack table makes it a lot easier to carry
 * it through various transforms that we apply to threads.
 * For example, here's a case where a stack's category is not recoverable from
 * any other information in the transformed thread:
 * In the call path
 *   someJSFunction [JS] -> Node.insertBefore [DOM] -> nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt,
 * the stack node for nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt should inherit the
 * category DOM from its "Node.insertBefore" prefix stack. And it should keep
 * the DOM category even if you apply the "Merge node into calling function"
 * transform to Node.insertBefore. This transform removes the stack node
 * "Node.insertBefore" from the stackTable, so the information about the DOM
 * category would be lost if it wasn't inherited into the
 * nsAttrAndChildArray::InsertChildAt stack before transforms are applied.
